# sutd-vn-engine

For this assignment, we are only allowed to use standard libraries.

## Installation

Poetry is used to maintain a clean virtual environment with no external dependencies. The head developer still requests dev dependencies for the sake of linting though.

```sh
poetry install
```

## Usage

```sh
poetry run python -m sutd_vn_engine
```

## Engine Format

TODO: A text format for parsing story & story branches. Does PyGame have a standard format we can implement?
